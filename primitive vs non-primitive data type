The difference between primitive and non-primitive data types in JavaScript is that primitive data types store their values directly, while non-primitive data types store references to values.

**Primitive data types:**

* Boolean
* Number
* String
* Null
* Undefined

**Non-primitive data types:**

* Object
* Function
* Array

Primitive data types are immutable, meaning that their values cannot be changed once they are assigned. Non-primitive data types are mutable, meaning that their values can be changed.

When a primitive value is assigned to a variable, a copy of the value is stored in the variable. When a non-primitive value is assigned to a variable, a reference to the value is stored in the variable.

This means that if you change the value of a non-primitive variable, the change will be reflected in all of the variables that reference the same value.

Here is an example:

// Primitive data type
let a = 10;
let b = a;
a = 20;
console.log(b); // 10

// Non-primitive data type
let c = { name: 'John Doe' };
let d = c;
c.name = 'Jane Doe';
console.log(d.name); // Jane Doe


In the first example, the variable `b` is assigned a copy of the value of the variable `a`. When the value of the variable `a` is changed, the value of the variable `b` is not affected.

In the second example, the variable `d` is assigned a reference to the object that is stored in the variable `c`. When the value of the object that is stored in the variable `c` is changed, the change is reflected in the variable `d`.

It is important to be aware of the difference between primitive and non-primitive data types in JavaScript. This can help you to avoid unexpected results in your code.

In general, it is recommended to use primitive data types whenever possible. This is because primitive data types are simpler and easier to understand.
